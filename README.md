# Asp.net-Core-API-Assignment

In this assignment, you will build a Web Application that will serve as an API.
Summary
You will be building a server that can keep track of tasks. Your server must be able
to do the following:
1. Create a new task with a title property and a boolean determining whether
the task has been completed. A new unique id would be created for each
new task.
2. List all tasks created
3. Get a specific task
4. Delete a specified task
5. Edit the title or completion of a specific task
6. Bulk add multiple tasks in one request
7. Bulk delete multiple tasks in one request
Your application will accept JSON and/or URL parameters and will return JSON data.
Your server would be ready to be automatically integrated in a web system.
Swagger should integrate to your application.
